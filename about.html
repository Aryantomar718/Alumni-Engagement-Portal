    <p>
        In addition to offering undergraduate, postgraduate, and post-doctoral programmes in a wide array of subjects such as Human Consciousness and Yogic Science, Psychology, Indian History and Culture, Theology, Computer Science and Application, Animation, Holistic Health, Tourism, Mathematics, Rural Entrepreneurship and Development, Environmental Science, Life Management, Scientific Spirituality, Languages, Education, Journalism and Mass Communication, etc., the university specialises in the character development of its students through fostering an uplifted lifestyle based on the spiritual practises of the east and the west. The result is well-rounded, as dynamic graduates are eager to channel their skills toward serving the needs of society.
        <br>
        The number of current faculty in the university is 119, out of which 66 possess Ph.D. degrees in different disciplines. More than 15,000 students, either through regular or via distance learning, have completed their education at the university. These students have come from different states of the country, reflecting the truly national character of the university. A unique feature of the university is seen in terms of Jeevandani (Life Donors) and Samaydani (Time Donors) karyakartas (volunteers) working as faculty and staff, and contributions made by socially conscious people through a unique process of Anshdan (PartDonation), which allows it to meet all its capital requirements and shortfall in revenue expenses. It has a provision to provide fellowships and scholarships to all economically disadvantaged students. It is worth mentioning that the university does not charge any tuition fees but only maintenance charges for the hostel, mess, library, laboratory, computers, etc. The internship programme is also one of the distinguishing features of the education at this university. This unique programme not only guarantees that students will apply what they have learned through the curriculum but also presents an opportunity for them to gain valuable career-related experience, make contacts in their chosen field, and better the world through their knowledge. An internship is compulsory for every course, and a special department of the university helps every student find an internship that suits his or her needs.
        <br>
        The university is funded solely by an international socio-spiritual organization, All World Gayatri Pariwar, which includes over 4,000 social reform and social service training centres and an international research institute dedicated to the study of scientific spirituality. Hundreds of programmes are being conducted by more than 5,00,000 volunteers worldwide in one of seven major areas of social reform. These include rural development, women’s empowerment, social reform, village autonomy, cultural revitalization, self-employment, and free health and free education for all. The movement as a whole is fuelled by the active participation of over 100 million members and has branches in more than 40 countries.
        The university has achieved many accolades not only in India but also abroad. The university has international collaborations with esteemed international institutions in the US, UK, Germany, Italy, China, Poland, Latvia, Indonesia, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Korea. The university is also the proud host of the world-famous annual International Festival of Yoga, Culture, and Spirituality. The research activities of the university are also appreciated at the international level, and the university proudly publishes a bi-annual international interdisciplinary journal called Dev Sanskriti. Two of the last five convocations of the university were presided over by the President of India, the most recent one in 2017. As a state-run private university, Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya has reached unimaginable milestones in its short journey of over 20 years. The growth has been comprehensive with collaborative efforts. The university ensures that its vision is contained while also indigenously innovating with global thinking. This approach has allowed it to venture into erudite interdisciplinary research within and outside India, for which various global collaborative efforts are underway.
